These ASICs have the unusual ability to select the internal 2 KB nametable RAM as a CHR bank page, allowing it to be used as CHR RAM in combination with the existing CHR ROM.

Registers
The 163 has 19 registers within $4800-$5FFF and $8000-$FFFF. Each register occupies a range of $800 bytes, so $4800-$4FFF all refers to one register, $5000-$57FF all refers to another register, and so on.

It is believed, but untested, that a game could add a normal SRAM and use it in lieu of the nametable RAM; if so, a game would be able to get 4-screen mirroring and many more pages of CHR-RAM.

Any value outside of the range $40-$4E will cause all PRG RAM to be read-only.

IRQ Operation
The IRQ is a 15-bit CPU cycle up-counter. $5000 and $5800 provide direct access to the counter itself (i.e., this isn't a reload value). Games can read and write to these registers in realtime.

The IRQ counter increments on each CPU cycle. Upon reaching $7FFF, an IRQ is fired, and it stops counting. Writing to $5000 or $5800 will acknowledge any pending IRQs.

Notes
Many older programs incorrectly identify this mapper by the name Namco 106. Some sources use the name Namcot instead of Namco, as some games and PCBs use this variation on the company name.
The N163 supports 8k of PRG-RAM but also has 128 bytes of internal memory. If there is a battery, then both will be battery backed. The internal memory is battery backed for several games that have no additional PRG-RAM.
The only known difference between the Namco 129 and 163 is the 129's faulty implementation of expansion audio. The only known game (Star Wars) using the Namco 129 can also be found in later runs with a Namco 163 ASIC.
Many INES Mapper 210 games are incorrectly set to Mapper 019.
Dokuganryuu Masamune is often thought as having WRAM. Tests have indicated however that the fourth glob is not SRAM but a protection circuit for the chip-internal RAM.
