Banks
CPU $6000-$7FFF: 8 KiB PRG RAM bank
CPU $8000-$BFFF: 16 KiB switchable PRG ROM bank
CPU $C000-$FFFF: 16 KiB PRG ROM bank, fixed to the last internal bank
PPU $0000-$07FF: 2 KiB switchable CHR bank
PPU $0800-$0FFF: 2 KiB switchable CHR bank
PPU $1000-$17FF: 2 KiB switchable CHR bank
PPU $1800-$1FFF: 2 KiB switchable CHR bank
PPU $2000-$23FF (and $2400 or $2800): 1 KiB switchable CHR bank
PPU $2C00-$2FFF (and $2800 or $2400): 1 KiB switchable CHR bank
Registers
$6000-$7FFF: Licensing IC
Only for the game Nantettatte!! Baseball, when WRAM is disabled ($F000.4 is 0), writes to this register reset a timer in the external option ROM cartridge. The external ROM is only readable while banked into $8000-$BFFF and the timer has not expired; once it has, reads from the external ROM should return open bus.

The game verifies that the timer expires after 107516 to 107575 M2 cycles (most likely exactly 107520=1024Â·105) by reading a signature from the end of the external ROM.

While WRAM is disabled, reads from $6000-$7FFF return open bus for all games. (The licensing IC isn't readable because it is connected to only M2, WRAM +CE, WRAM /CE, and R/W. None of the data pins connect.)

$8000-$8FFF: CHR bank at $0000
Map a 2 KiB CHR ROM bank into PPU $0000.

$9000-$9FFF: CHR bank at $0800
Map a 2 KiB CHR ROM bank into PPU $0800.

$A000-$AFFF: CHR bank at $1000
Map a 2 KiB CHR ROM bank into PPU $1000.

$B000-$BFFF: CHR bank at $1800
Map a 2 KiB CHR ROM bank into PPU $1800.

$C000-$CFFF: Nametable register 0
Map a 1 KiB CHR ROM bank in place of the lower nametable (CIRAM $000-$3FF). Only D6-D0 are used; D7 is ignored and treated as 1, so nametables must be in the last 128 KiB of CHR ROM.

$D000-$DFFF: Nametable register 1
Map a 1 KiB CHR ROM bank in place of the upper nametable (CIRAM $400-$7FF). Only D6-D0 are used; D7 is ignored and treated as 1.

$E000-$EFFF: Nametable control

Nametable mirroring works the same way in both CIRAM and CHR ROM modes.

           0:Enable licensing verification
Note that although the external ROM could be up to 128KiB, both known subcartridges contain 16KiB of data, doubled to fill a 32KiB EPROM, mirrored across the bottom 128KiB.

The fixed bank is always from the internal ROM.

Hardware
The US release of After Burner has CHR ROM split into two 28-pin chips. The Japanese releases exist both as two 32-pin 128KiB CHR ROMs with extra enables and as one 32-pin 256KiB ROM.
